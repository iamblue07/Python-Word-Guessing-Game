This is a Python project I'm currently working on as a way to learn how to use different Python libraries independently. Currently, I am utilizing the following libraries: random, pygame, and pygame_menu. At present, the game is playable through the console. It features 5 difficulty levels, each determined by the length of the words. The words are stored in various .txt files corresponding to their lengths. Users can also add new words, which will be automatically categorized into the appropriate difficulty level based on word length.

During gameplay, whenever the user correctly guesses a letter, all occurrences of that letter are revealed, while other letters remain hidden with a '-' character. The game concludes either when the user successfully guesses all letters or when they make 5 incorrect guesses. Multiple validations are implemented to detect incorrect inputs, such as using numbers instead of letters and vice versa, or typing multiple letters instead of one.

I am currently in the early stages of developing a graphical interface using pygame and pygame_menu. Future plans include implementing additional features such as a timer, player score, sound effects, and a "Hint" button.
